						<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
					</div>
					
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>I am a 20-year-old university student from Binzhou, Shandong Province, China, studying Information Management for Business at University College London. My academic interests span economics, mathematics, physics, and computer science, providing me with a broad perspective and deep analytical abilities. I have actively engaged in various practical activities and competitions, such as the ASDAN Business Simulation, Student Investment Competition, and National Economics Challenge, which have significantly enhanced my practical skills and teamwork capabilities. Additionally, I have independently developed projects such as a bank loan repayment prediction model using R language and a research project on game theory, both of which have strengthened my programming and data analysis skills while deepening my understanding of economic and mathematical model applications.</p>
